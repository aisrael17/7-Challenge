# 7-Challenge
Challenge 7 for the Columbia FinTech Boot Camp

## Technologies
For this project, I used Python 3 and the following external libraries:

* numpy
* pandas
* hvplot
* sql alchemy

## Data
For this project, I used stock data on PayPal, Goldman Sachs, Square, and Green Dot over a period ranging from December 16, 2016 until December 4, 2020. I accessed this data, which is stored in a SQL database, using the sqlalchemy library. 



## Project Description
This project entailed building a hypothetical fintech ETF by interacting with a SQL database of stock price data. 

First, I graphed the daily price returns and cumulative returns of PYPL. Then, I looked at dates when the price of PYPL was higher than \$200 and the top 10 days of returns. 

Then, I built a theoretical Fintech portfolio combining the returns of the stocks listed above. I calculated the daily returns of this ETF and plotted the cumulative returns over time.
